# Blood_Donation-prediction
Blood Donation Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts whether a donor is likely to donate blood again based on past donation records. I performed data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and built classification models using Python and Scikit-learn to help improve donor retention strategies and blood bank planning.
